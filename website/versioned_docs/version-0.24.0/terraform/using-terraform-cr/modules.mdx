# Primitive Modules

This document describes how to use the Weave TF-controller with a primitive module.
It requires TF-controller v0.13+ to run the example.

## What is a primitive module?

It's a Terraform module that contains only a single resource.

  * A Terraform primitive module must contains the "values" variable.
  * The "values" variable must be an object with fields of optional types.
  * The module must be placed under a directory, which is named after the resource.
  * The directory can optionally contain other files, for example the .terraform.lock.hcl.
  * We call a set of primitive modules bundled into an OCI image, a package.

## Hello World Primitive Module

Here is an example of how a primitive module can be defined in YAML.
Assume that we have a ready-to-use OCI image with a primitive module for the imaginary resource `aws_hello_world`,
and the image is tagged as `ghcr.io/tf-controller/hello-primitive-modules/v4.32.0:v1`.

We'll use the following Terraform object definition to provision the resource.

1. We need to create a Terraform object with the `spec.sourceRef.kind` field
set to `OCIRepository` and the `spec.sourceRef.name` field set to the name of the OCIRepository object.

2. We need to set the `spec.path` field to the name of the resource, in this case `aws_hello_world`.

3. We need to set the `spec.values` field to the values of the resource. This is a YAML object that
will be converted to an HCL variable, and passed to the Terraform module.

4. We need to set the `spec.approvePlan` field to `auto` to automatically approve the plan.
